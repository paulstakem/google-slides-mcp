# Google Slides MCP Server

This project provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for interacting with the Google Slides API. It allows you to create, read, and modify Google Slides presentations programmatically.

## Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
* npm (usually comes with Node.js)
* Google Cloud Project with the Google Slides API enabled.
* OAuth 2.0 Credentials (Client ID and Client Secret) for your Google Cloud Project.
* A Google Refresh Token associated with the OAuth 2.0 credentials and the necessary Google Slides API scopes.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository (if applicable) or ensure you are in the project directory.**

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Build the Server:**
    Compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    This will create a `build` directory containing the compiled JavaScript code.

4. **Obtain Google API Credentials:**
    * Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    * Create a new project or select an existing one.
    * Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Enabled APIs & services".
    * Click "+ ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES", search for "Google Slides API", and enable it.
    * Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials".
    * Click "+ CREATE CREDENTIALS" > "OAuth client ID".
    * If prompted, configure the OAuth consent screen. For "User type", choose "External" unless you have a Google Workspace account and want to restrict it internally. Provide an app name, user support email, and developer contact information.
    * On the "Scopes" page during consent screen setup, click "ADD OR REMOVE SCOPES". Search for and add the following scopes:
        * `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/presentations` (To view and manage your presentations)
        * *(Optional: Add `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly` or other Drive scopes if needed for specific operations like listing files, although not strictly required for basic Slides operations)*
    * Save the consent screen configuration.
    * Go back to "Credentials", click "+ CREATE CREDENTIALS" > "OAuth client ID".
    * Select "Desktop app" as the Application type.
    * Give it a name (e.g., "Slides MCP Client").
    * Click "Create". You will see your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. **Copy these down securely.** You can also download the JSON file containing these credentials.

5. **Obtain a Google Refresh Token:**
    * A refresh token allows the server to obtain new access tokens without requiring user interaction each time. Generating one typically involves a one-time authorization flow.
    * You can use the [Google OAuth 2.0 Playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/) for this:
        * Go to the OAuth 2.0 Playground.
        * Click the gear icon (Settings) in the top right.
        * Check "Use your own OAuth credentials".
        * Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** you obtained in the previous step.
        * In the "Step 1 - Select & authorize APIs" section on the left, find "Slides API v1" and select the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/presentations` scope (and any other Drive scopes if you added them).
        * Click "Authorize APIs".
        * Sign in with the Google account you want the server to act on behalf of.
        * Grant the requested permissions.
        * You will be redirected back to the Playground. In "Step 2 - Exchange authorization code for tokens", you should see the **Refresh token** and Access token. **Copy the Refresh token securely.**

    Alternatively, you can use the provided `get-token` script to obtain a refresh token. This script will build the project and then run a utility that guides you through the OAuth flow to get a refresh token. Ensure your `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` are configured in your environment or a `.env` file if the script requires them (you may need to check the `src/getRefreshToken.ts` file for details on how it expects credentials). To run the script:

    ```bash
    npm run get-token
    ```

6. **Configure Credentials and Command in MCP Settings:**
    Locate your MCP settings file (e.g., `.../User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`). Find or create the entry for `"google-slides-mcp"` and configure it with the command to run the server and your credentials:

    ```json
    "google-slides-mcp": {
      "transportType": "stdio",
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/google-slides-mcp/build/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
        "GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
        "GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN": "YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN"
      }
      // ... other optional settings like description ...
    }
    ```

    Replace `/path/to/google-slides-mcp/build/index.js` with the actual path to the compiled server index file on your system. Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID`, `YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN` with the actual values you obtained. The MCP runner will inject these values into the server's environment when it starts.

## Running the Server

Execute the compiled code:

```bash
npm run start
```

The server will start and listen for MCP requests on standard input/output (stdio). You should see a message like: `Google Slides MCP server running and connected via stdio.`

## Available Tools

The server exposes the following tools via the Model Context Protocol:

* **`create_presentation`**: Creates a new Google Slides presentation.
  * **Input:**
    * `title` (string, required): The title for the new presentation.
  * **Output:** JSON object representing the created presentation details.

* **`get_presentation`**: Retrieves details about an existing presentation.
  * **Input:**
    * `presentationId` (string, required): The ID of the presentation to retrieve.
    * `fields` (string, optional): A field mask (e.g., "slides,pageSize") to limit the returned data.
  * **Output:** JSON object representing the presentation details.

* **`batch_update_presentation`**: Applies a series of updates to a presentation. This is the primary method for modifying slides (adding text, shapes, images, creating slides, etc.).
  * **Input:**
    * `presentationId` (string, required): The ID of the presentation to update.
    * `requests` (array, required): An array of request objects defining the updates. Refer to the [Google Slides API `batchUpdate` documentation](https://developers.google.com/slides/api/reference/rest/v1/presentations/batchUpdate#requestbody) for the structure of individual requests.
    * `writeControl` (object, optional): Controls write request execution (e.g., using revision IDs).
  * **Output:** JSON object representing the result of the batch update.

* **`get_page`**: Retrieves details about a specific page (slide) within a presentation.
  * **Input:**
    * `presentationId` (string, required): The ID of the presentation containing the page.
    * `pageObjectId` (string, required): The object ID of the page (slide) to retrieve.
  * **Output:** JSON object representing the page details.

* **`summarize_presentation`**: Extracts and formats all text content from a presentation for easier summarization.
  * **Input:**
    * `presentationId` (string, required): The ID of the presentation to summarize.
    * `include_notes` (boolean, optional): Whether to include speaker notes in the summary. Defaults to false.
  * **Output:** JSON object containing:
    * `title`: The presentation's title
    * `slideCount`: Total number of slides
    * `lastModified`: Revision information
    * `slides`: Array of slide objects containing:
      * `slideNumber`: Position in presentation
      * `slideId`: Object ID of the slide
      * `content`: All text extracted from the slide
      * `notes`: Speaker notes (if requested and available)

*(More tools can be added by extending `src/index.ts`)*

## Development

### Testing

This project uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) as its testing framework. Vitest is a fast, modern test runner that's compatible with Jest APIs but optimized for Vite and ESM projects.

#### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests once
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (re-runs on file changes)
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests with UI interface
npm run test:ui
```

#### Test Structure

Tests are located in `__tests__` directories alongside the code they test. For example:
- `src/tools/__tests__/createPresentation.test.ts` - Tests for the create presentation tool

#### Writing Tests

Tests use Vitest's API which is compatible with Jest:

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect, beforeEach, vi } from 'vitest';

describe('Feature: My Feature', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup code
  });

  it('should do something', () => {
    // Test code
    expect(result).toBe(expected);
  });
});
```

For mocking, use Vitest's `vi` object:

```typescript
const mockFunction = vi.fn();
vi.spyOn(console, 'error').mockImplementation(() => {});
```

#### Coverage Reports

Coverage reports are generated in the `coverage` directory when running `npm run test:coverage`. The report includes:
- Text summary in the terminal
- HTML report in `coverage/index.html`
- JSON report in `coverage/coverage-final.json`

### Linting

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Building

```bash
npm run build
```
